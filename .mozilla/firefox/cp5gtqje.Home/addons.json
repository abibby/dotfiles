Due to security restrictions imposed by Mozilla, local file:// URLs will NOT work.\n    The technique this extension uses to keep focus in the address bar means the site you choose as your new tab page must allow iframing.\n    Links on the site you choose will open in the iframe (issue #1). If you control the site add target=\"_top\" to the links to make them open in the top frame.\n\n\nIf you're looking for a new new-tab page then check out my site Zen.","weeklyDownloads":0,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"MethodGrab","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12598103/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.15,"reviewCount":23,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page/reviews/","updateDate":1589135112000},{"id":"{11bcf30b-c8f7-4685-b285-3944c02768af}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/802/802090-32.png?modified=1491315621","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/802/802090-64.png?modified=1491315621","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/802/802090-128.png?modified=1491315621"},"name":"MDN Search","version":"1.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/622427/mdn_code_search-1.0-an+fx-linux.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/clarkbw/mdn-code-search","supportURL":"https://github.com/clarkbw/mdn-reference-search","description":"To use, type 'mdn' plus your search term into the url bar.
